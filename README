This is a AVR GNU Assembly implementation of snake game for `atmega328p'

For required hardware and its config see `schem.pdf'
Other than that avr-gcc is needed for building the code and avrdude for flashing.

Run:
```
% make flash
```
et voilÃ !

Beware! This code still contains loads of borked cruft that is a result of
not-so-sophisticated debugging and general experimantation.
